Bigloo on Raspberry PI - 9 Dec 2019
===================================

The easiest way to get Bigloo running on a Raspberry PI is to compile
and install it natively on the device. With current devices performance
(speed and stotage capacity), this is the recommended procedure.
However, if cross compilation is to be used, read the README.cross.md
file for the procedure.
